## Description
A simple web-based calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, developed during my internship at **Code Alpha**.  
It supports basic arithmetic operations, percentage, and square root calculations.  

> ⚠️ The calculator's color scheme is basic for now — still working on improving its design.
